# News Site
Planet Uplift

- Brief description of the assignment:

A news site that compiles articles from reputable online sources, all of which highlight positive developments in nature and climate.

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it:

I used ChatGPT to generate ideas for the name of the website, topics of the main articles and examples of news sites that are similar in content. 
I chose this website as a reference and inspected the code in order to mimic its structure: https://www.positive.news/

Other good references:
  - https://wwf.panda.org/ 
  - https://www.optimistdaily.com/
  - https://ideas.ted.com/ or https://www.ted.com/

The content of the articles is taken from WWF and Nature.

- If you had more time, what would be next?
    - Social media links/icons on the secondary navigation bar
    - collapsing menu for the "Sections" link in the primary navigation
    - zoom in effect on hovering over the big news image
