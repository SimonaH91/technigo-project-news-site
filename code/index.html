      <h2>Coastal communities lead successful marine conservation efforts</h2>
      <h3>A new report highlights the importance of communities in conserving and managing resources, and their
        collective
        contributions to building healthy and resilient coastal ecosystems.</h3>
      <p>Indigenous Peoples, local communities and small-scale fishers have long been the custodians of remarkable
        coastal
        ecosystems. They are the unsung heroes of marine conservation, the stewards of coastal habitats teeming with
        biodiversity, and the keepers of time-honoured traditions. WWF’s Coastal Communities Initiative, spanning 29
        countries, is elevating the role coastal communities play as ocean stewards, and working alongside community
        leaders to secure their rights to a healthy and bountiful environment.

        The Coastal Communities Initiative Impact Report details results and progress of efforts aimed at accelerating
        and
        scaling community-led conservation. The data and stories presented in the report offer insights into the
        effectiveness of inclusive conservation strategies, such as implementing human rights-based approaches,
        promoting
        gender equality, fostering participatory governance and social inclusion.

        “Coastal communities are vital custodians of their ecosystems, but face growing threats from industry and
        climate
        change. Urgent action is needed to address biodiversity loss and empower community-led conservation. This impact
        report is a story of our collective action over the last three years, attaining impact at scale and ushering a
        new
        era for coastal community-led conservation,” says Maria Honig, WWF Coastal Communities Initiative Lead.

        Starting with 62 sites in 2019, the Coastal Communities Initiative has scaled out community-led conservation
        best
        practices to 128 sites in 29 countries. More than 700 local and international partners have been involved to
        date,
        protecting 87 million hectares of critical coastal habitats through the establishment of 84 marine protected
        areas
        or locally managed marine areas, and 540 co-management units. This work directly benefits 300,000+
        rights-holders,
        including 120,000 women and 74,000 young people (15-24 years), indirectly benefiting more than 1.5 million
        stakeholders.</p>
